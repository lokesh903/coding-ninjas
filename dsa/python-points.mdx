ord("A") = gives ascii value of A
char(123) = gives char at ascii value 123

a = "abcdef" >= "abcd" , is True because => 
The expression "abcdef" >= "abcd" returns True in Python because it is comparing two strings lexicographically (dictionary order)

st = "hello"
st[0] = 'r' it wont work 

Else with loops = In Python, the else statement can be used in conjunction with loops, including while and for loops. The else block is executed when the loop completes all its iterations without encountering a break statement.
Fibonacci sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,

## List
>>> l1=[1,2,3,4]
>>> l2=[5,6,7,8]
>>> l1.extend(l2) #Adds contents of l2 to l1 at the end
>>> l1
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]


>>> li=[1,2,3,4]
>>> li.insert(2,5) #Insert 5 at the index no. 2
>>> li
[1,2,5,3,4]
if we insert in the list at index greater then its length then it will insert at the end
>>> l1=[1,2,3,4,4,3,5,4,4,2]
>>> c= l1.count(4) #Number of times 4 occurs in the list
>>> c
4

>>> l1=[1,1,12,3]
>>> del l1[2]
>>> l1
[1,1,3]

>>> l1=[1,1,12,3]
>>> l1.remove(12)
>>> l1
[1,1,3]


In[1]: li= [int(x) for x in input().split()]


### Resizing of list


### Passing the list to the function

def change(li):
    li[1] = li[1] + 2
    li = [3,3,3,4,5]
li = [1,2,3,4,5]
change(li)
print(li)

Ans  = [1,4,3,4,5]
